I do programming focused on Rust in the low level space, particularly for the RISC-V architecture, with my work prioritising new technologies. Along with low level development I have worked on integrating my physics realistic magic system library for Godot. My newer work can be found on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/CocytusDEDI).
